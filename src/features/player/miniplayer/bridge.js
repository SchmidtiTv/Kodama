/**
 * Mini player ↔ main window plumbing.
 *
 * The mini player is a real Tauri window, so it gets its own JS context — the in-process
 * store in bigpicture/playerBridge.js cannot reach it (that one only works because Big
 * Picture is rendered inside the main window's React root).
 *
 * State goes out as a broadcast event. Commands come back on "media-control", the very
 * channel the OS media keys already use (src-tauri/src/media.rs → App.jsx), so the main
 * window needs no extra transport logic for the mini player at all.
 *
 * Position is sent as a timestamped anchor rather than a stream: the receiver knows the
 * position, when it was measured, and whether the clock is running, and interpolates the
 * rest locally. That keeps this at roughly one message per second instead of one per
 * progress tick.
