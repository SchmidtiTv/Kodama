# Kodama Backend Guide

Treat the modular application under `src/`
as the source of truth; do not add route handlers or application state to
`server.py`.

## Entry Points and Composition

- `server.py` is the executable entry point. It creates the Flask application
  and passes it to `run_server()`.
- `src/__init__.py:create_app()` is the composition root. It creates shared
  services, restores a saved profile, registers blueprints, and configures
  runtime helpers.
- `src/routes/__init__.py` owns the blueprint registry. Add a new blueprint
  there only after its route package is ready.
- PyInstaller specs and `build_server.bat` build `server.py`; keep them aligned
  if the entry point ever changes.

## Project Layout

| Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/routes/<domain>/` | Flask blueprints, request validation, and HTTP responses. |
| `src/lib/<domain>/` | Reusable domain logic and stateful services. |
| `src/config.py` | Application configuration and filesystem locations. |
| `tests/` | Route and runtime tests using isolated fakes. |

Route families are organized by domain: `auth`, `profiles`, `library`,
`streaming`, `discovery`, `downloads`, `lyrics`, `composer`, `cache`, `lastFm`,
`operations`, and `root`.

## Adding or Changing Backend Features

1. Place an endpoint in the closest existing `src/routes/<domain>/` package.
   Create a new package and blueprint only when the feature is a distinct
   domain.
2. Keep routes thin: validate input, call a service, and format the response.
3. Put shared logic, caches, and mutable state in `src/lib/`. Register shared
   instances in `create_app()` and retrieve them from `app.extensions` through
   the domain's `_services.py` helpers.
4. Use the active client through `YoutubeMusicSession.get_active_client()` and
   profile state through `session.state`; do not create ad-hoc `YTMusic`
   clients inside routes.
5. Add or update focused tests under `tests/`. Route tests should use
   `RouteTestCase` and its fakes instead of real network or profile data.

## Profiles and Startup

- `YoutubeMusicSession.autoload_first_profile()` restores an available saved
  account during application creation. Do not move this work into a request
  handler.
- Local profiles are supported alongside Google-authenticated profiles. Check
  `Profile.is_local(name)` before accessing remote YouTube Music data.
- Authentication headers and user profile data are sensitive. Do not log,
  commit, or expose their contents in API errors.

## Verification

From `python-backend/`, use the project virtual environment when available:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
git diff --check
```

For a lightweight syntax check that does not import optional dependencies:

```sh
python3 -c "import ast, pathlib; [ast.parse(p.read_text(encoding='utf-8'), filename=str(p)) for p in pathlib.Path('src').rglob('*.py')]; print('AST OK')"
```

If the system Python lacks Flask or other backend dependencies, use the project
virtual environment rather than installing packages globally.
