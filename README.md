> Kodama is in active **alpha**.

## Features

- **Synced lyrics** with word- and syllable-level timing, plus **Unison** community lyrics.
- **Lyrics Composer** for creating and editing your own.
- **Crossfade** and a built-in **visualizer**.
- **Remote control** from your phone.
- **OBS overlay** for streaming.
- **Offline downloads**, Discord Rich Presence, and Last.fm scrobbling.

## Download

Grab the latest build from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/KiyoshiTheDevil/Kodama/releases/latest) page:

**Windows:** download and run the `*_x64-setup.exe` installer from the latest release.

**macOS (Apple Silicon):** the build is **unsigned**, so install it with this command (it
downloads the latest release and avoids Gatekeeper's quarantine):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KiyoshiTheDevil/Kodama/master/install.sh | bash
```

Automatic Updates on macOS are currently not functional. Hopefully I can fix it in the near future.

## Screenshots

<!-- TODO: add fresh screenshots of the current app (player, lyrics, library, settings). -->

A Google account is not required to use the player, Premium isn't required either.
Please be aware, that some content might be inaccessable due to Premium restrictions.
